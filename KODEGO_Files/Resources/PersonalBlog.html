<p1>Hi there!<img src="https://media.tenor.com/3lcf0JZoUE4AAAAj/human-hand.gif" alt="hand gif" style="float: var(body);width: 20px;height: 25px;"><br>
It's me, Jhay<br></p1>
<p1>I just want to share with you guys my journey to web development. It is all started during the pandemic when I quit my job because I don’t feel the excitement anymore. I feel that I’m stuck into my comfort zone doing things that I already know 2 years ago. The struggle in going to work everyday and the strict protocols brought by Covid also some up to the situation. Then 1 day when I’m riding the bus going back home, while surfing the internet, an article caught my attention. I realize the biggest advantage of IT professionals in today’s industry, they can work remote from the comfort of their home, there is a lot of opportunities out there, plus a huge compensation package. It’s really attractive and all I can say is “really?”. So I do make a research about their field of work, what did they do, what is the interesting part of their job, and I found it really challenging and interesting. Then I found “Web Development”. I think I can do it because I had a basic  foundation in Computer literacy. I had a little knowledge in programming way back in college and exposure in program debugging in my previous job. </p1>
