    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>Glad to see you here, welcome to my blog. This blog is all about my journey to web Development.
      It is a long story before I came up to this career, from construction worker, promo dicer, pool watcher, warehouse crew, up to manufacturing technician.
      I experienced a lot of things and those experiences teaches me a lesson in life. I know I am far away to my desired destination, but
      I know one day I will reach those place that I wanted to be. It reminds me of my father once told me <i>"It doesn’t matter if you do it slow, as long as your determination and proactive desire still
      remain and never stop".</i> 
    </p>
    <p>Rainy season of 2022 when I quit my job as a Senior Test Technician in a Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry. It is eight years of solid technical experience
      the longest job that I ever committed. I love the job before because it is full of challenge and I am curious about my job, the automation testing, the electromechanical concept that applied to the real world.
      I am happy fixing and exploring those things and my curiosity satisfied. Years goes by and I never imagined it is almost a decade and I feel the torch of my determination slowly fading. Then I realize that I am stuck into my comfort zone, doing things that I already knew and its bore me and I want change.
    </p>

      Then I meet KodeGO, an organization offering a bootcamp and teach how to code and to develop websites. I do research about web development, the nature of their job, what are they doing then I found it interesting.
